	To start the program you want to launch the "NumberGuessingAssessment.exe" which is located inside the "NumberGuessingAssessment" folder then inside the "bin" folder then "release" folder.
		(If you do not see "NumberGuessingAssessment.exe", your computer is hiding extensions from you, in that event you would launch "NumberGuessingAssessment"

	The program will tell you to think of a number between 1 and 100, after doing so press enter to continue.

	The program will then ask you if your number is greater than(G), less than(L), or equel(E) to the number it printed.

		If you press "G" the program will then print a higher number.
		If you press "L" the program will then print a lower number.
			(After the number is printed after pressing "G" or "L", the program will ask you if your number is greater, lower, or equel to again.)

		If you press "E" the program will the state the number has been solved then end.

	Known bugs:
		When getting closer to guessing your number it will sometimes repeat the same number.
